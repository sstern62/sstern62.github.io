        <h1> Bowie's Santa Monica Trip</h1>
        </header>
       <h2> After his Big Bear trip, Bowie went to Santa Monica, California to visit his aunt at her college apartment. This was Bowie's first big trip to a major city and he did great! Everyone was very proud to see how well he behaved in such a crowded area.</h2>
